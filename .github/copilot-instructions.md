# Copilot Instructions for copilot-agents Repository

## Repository Overview

This repository contains custom agents built for GitHub Copilot. Custom agents are specialized AI assistants that extend Copilot's capabilities for specific tasks or domains.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to develop, maintain, and share custom agents that enhance the GitHub Copilot experience by providing:
- Domain-specific expertise
- Specialized workflows and automations
- Task-oriented AI assistants

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow clear and consistent naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code with descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious implementations
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Agent Development
- Each custom agent should have a clear, well-defined purpose
- Document the agent's capabilities and limitations
- Include examples of use cases for each agent
- Test agents thoroughly before deployment

### Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document all configuration options
- Provide clear examples and usage instructions
- Keep documentation alongside the code it describes

### Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Use feature branches for development
- Ensure main branch is always stable

## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: Keep agents modular and reusable
2. **Testing**: Test agents with various inputs and edge cases
3. **Security**: Never include sensitive data or credentials in agent definitions
4. **Performance**: Optimize agent responses for speed and accuracy
5. **User Experience**: Design agents to be intuitive and helpful
